Reading Light
=============

Reading Light is a very simple iOS app which only has one purpose: to provide light by presenting a completely white main screen. The brightness is set to 100% initially when the app opens, but can be changed by tapping the info icon in the lower right corner.

Currently the app is not published on the App Store.
